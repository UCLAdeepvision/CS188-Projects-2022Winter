> This blog will contain updates and technical explanations for Felix Zhang's CS188 Project. The focus of project Terraform is to explore various approaches to controlling and generating 3-D scenes. We are not sure exact approach currently but are actively investigating Generative Neural Radiance Fields as well as Generative Adversial Networks as potential candidates.

## Team Paradigm Initial Project Proposal

### Group Members: Felix Zhang

### Topic: Terraform, Guided 3D Scene Generation (with exploration of Generative Neural Radiance Fields and Unsupervised Techniques)

There has been a recent surge in using exploring image generation in three dimensions due to the adoption of virtual, augmented, and mixed reality devices, as well as the possibility of using scenes to power downstream task datasets for agents. We explore in project Terraform various techniques to guide 3D Scene Generation, especially focusing on a recent interesting development of Generation with Neural Radiance Fields.

## Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)

Neural Radiance Fields are a recent development introduced by [Mildenhall et al.](https://www.matthewtancik.com/nerf) for 3d image synthesis by optimizing a volumetric function with a multi-layer perceptron network. The achieve impressive results compared to traditional generative techniques.

## Main Content
Your survey starts here. You can refer to the [source code](https://github.com/lilianweng/lil-log/tree/master/_posts) of [lil's blogs](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/) for article structure ideas or Markdown syntax. We've provided a [sample post](https://ucladeepvision.github.io/CS188-Projects-2022Winter/2017/06/21/an-overview-of-deep-learning.html) from Lilian Weng and you can find the source code [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UCLAdeepvision/CS188-Projects-2022Winter/main/_posts/2017-06-21-an-overview-of-deep-learning.md)

### Code Block
```
# This is a sample code block
import torch
print (torch.__version__)
```


### Formula
Please use latex to generate formulas, such as:

$$
\tilde{\mathbf{z}}^{(t)}_i = \frac{\alpha \tilde{\mathbf{z}}^{(t-1)}_i + (1-\alpha) \mathbf{z}_i}{1-\alpha^t}
$$

or you can write in-text formula $$y = wx + b$$. -->
