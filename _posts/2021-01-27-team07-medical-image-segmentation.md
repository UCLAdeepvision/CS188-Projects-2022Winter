> The use of deep learning methods in medical image analysis has contributed to the rise of new fast and reliable techniques for the diagnosis, evaluation, and quantification of human diseases. We will study and discuss various robust deep learning frameworks used in medical image segmentation, such as PDV-Net, Res-UNet-R, and Res-UNet-H. Furthermore, we will implement our own neural network to explore and demonstrate the capabilities of deep learning in this medical field.

## Main Content
Our team explores the applications of CV in healthcare; specifically, notable state-of-the-art medical image segmentation methods. Areas of interest include biomimetic frameworks for human neuromuscular and visuomotor control, segmentation of mitochondria, and segmentation of healthy and pathological lung lobes.
